# data structure

## queue

*   ["java queue - detailed analysis of queue"](https://www.cnblogs.com/lemon-flm/p/7877898.html)

    *   Non-blocking queue: ConcurrentLinkedQueue (unbounded thread safe), using CAS mechanism (compareAndSwapObject atomic operation).
    *   Blocking queues: ArrayBlockingQueue (bounded), LinkedBlockingQueue (unbounded), DelayQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue, using lock mechanism; use ReentrantLock lock.
*   ["LinkedList, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue Comparative Analysis"](https://www.cnblogs.com/mantu/p/5802393.html)

## set

*   ["Details of Java Set Collection"](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_33642117/article/details/52040345)

## Lists, arrays

*   ["Java Collection Detailed - What is a List"](https://blog.csdn.net/wz249863091/article/details/52853360)

## Dictionary, associative array

*   ["Java map details - usage, traversal, sorting, common APIs, etc."](https://baike.xsoftlab.net/view/250.html)

## Stack

*   ["Stack design and implementation of java data structure and algorithm"](https://blog.csdn.net/javazejian/article/details/53362993)
*   [Java Stack Class](http://www.runoob.com/java/java-stack-class.html)
*   ["Detailed Implementation Analysis of Java Stack"](https://blog.csdn.net/f2006116/article/details/51375225)
    *   Stack is thread-safe.
    *   Internal use array to save data, double when not enough.

## tree

### Binary tree

Each node has a maximum of two leaf nodes.

*   [Binary Tree](https://blog.csdn.net/cai2016/article/details/52589952)

### Complete Binary Tree

*   [Complete Binary Tree](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E4%BA%8C%E5%8F%89%E6%A0%91/7773232?fr=aladdin)
    *   The leaf nodes can only appear at the bottom and sub-lower levels, and the nodes at the bottom level are all concentrating on the binary tree at the leftmost position of the layer.

### Balanced binary tree

The absolute value of the height difference between the left and right two subtrees does not exceed one, and both the left and right subtrees are balanced binary trees.

*   ["On Data Structure - Balanced Binary Tree"](http://www.cnblogs.com/polly333/p/4798944.html)
*   ["On the algorithm and data structure: eight balanced tree search 2-3 tree"](http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-2-3-Search-Tree.html)

### 

Binary Search Trees, also called ordered binary trees, are sorted binary trees.

*   ["On the algorithm and data structure: seven binary search tree"](http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-Binary-Search-Tree.html)

### Red black tree

*   ["Easiest to understand red and black trees"](https://blog.csdn.net/sun_tttt/article/details/65445754)
    *   After the addition phase, left-handed or right-handed to reach equilibrium again.
*   ["On Algorithms and Data Structures: Nine Balanced Search Trees for Red and Black Trees"](http://www.cnblogs.com/yangecnu/p/Introduce-Red-Black-Tree.html)

### B-, B+, B* trees

MySQL is based on the B+ tree clustered index organization table

*   ["B-tree, B+ tree, B* tree"](https://blog.csdn.net/aqzwss/article/details/53074186)
*   ["Comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of B-trees, B+ trees and B* trees"](https://blog.csdn.net/bigtree_3721/article/details/73632405)
    *   The tree structure of the leaf nodes of the B+ tree is more convenient than the B-tree for scanning and range retrieval.

### LSM tree

Compared with B+ trees, LSM (Log-Structured Merge-Trees) sacrifices partial read performance in exchange for write performance (through batch writes) and achieves read and write.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hbase, LevelDB, Tair (Long DB), and nessDB use the structure of the LSM tree.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">LSM can quickly establish an index.

*   [LSM Tree vs B+ Tree](https://blog.csdn.net/dbanote/article/details/8897599)

    *   The B+ tree read performance is good, but due to the need for an orderly structure, the disk seeks frequently when the keys are scattered, resulting in write performance.
    *   LSM divides a large tree into N small trees, first writes to memory (without seeking problems, high performance), and builds an ordered small tree (ordered tree) in memory. The bigger the memory tree is flushed to disk.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When reading, because it does not know which tree the data is on, it is necessary to traverse (bi-search) all the small trees, but the data is ordered inside each small tree.
*   [LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree Storage Engine)](https://blog.csdn.net/u014774781/article/details/52105708)

    *   In extreme terms, the write performance of HBase based on the LSM tree is an order of magnitude higher than that of MySQL, and the read performance is an order of magnitude lower.
    *   Optimization method: Bloom filter replaces binary search; compact decimal tree, improves query performance.
    *   In Hbase, when the memory reaches a certain threshold, the entire flush flushes to disk and forms a file (B+ number). HDFS does not support the update operation. Therefore, Hbase does an overall flush instead of a merge update.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flush to the small tree on the disk, periodically merged into a big tree.

## BitSet

It is often used for checking the weight of large-scale data.

*   ["Java Bitset Class"](http://www.runoob.com/java/java-bitset-class.html)
*   [Java BitSet (bit set)](https://blog.csdn.net/caiandyong/article/details/51581160)

# Common algorithms

*   ["Common sorting algorithms and their corresponding time complexity and space complexity"](https://blog.csdn.net/gane_cheng/article/details/52652705)

## Sorting, finding algorithm

*   ["Common sorting algorithms and their corresponding time complexity and space complexity"](https://blog.csdn.net/gane_cheng/article/details/52652705)

### Select sort

*   ["Selection Sort of Classic Algorithms in Java"](https://www.cnblogs.com/shen-hua/p/5424059.html)
    *   Each tick selects the smallest element from the records to be sorted, and the order is placed at the end of the sorted sequence until all records are sorted.

### Bubble Sort

*   ["Two kinds of writing bubble sorting"](https://blog.csdn.net/shuaizai88/article/details/73250615)
    *   Exchange adjacent elements before and after, the largest row to the end.
    *   Time complexity O(n2)

### Insert sort

*   ["Sorting algorithm summary insertion sort"](https://www.cnblogs.com/hapjin/p/5517667.html)

### Quick sort

*   [Sitting on the toilet looking algorithm: quick sort](http://developer.51cto.com/art/201403/430986.htm)
    *   One side is larger or smaller than the other.

### Merge sort

*   ["Image Sorting Algorithm (4) Merge and Sorting"](http://www.cnblogs.com/chengxiao/p/6194356.html)
    *   Divide and conquer, sort into small parts and merge (recreate a new space for copying).

### Hill Sort

TODO

### Heap sort

*   ["Graphical sorting algorithm (three) of the heap sort"](https://www.cnblogs.com/chengxiao/p/6129630.html)
    *   The sorting process is the process of building a maximum heap. The maximum heap: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its child nodes, and the top element is the maximum value.

### Counting sort

*   [Counting and Bucket Sorting](https://www.cnblogs.com/suvllian/p/5495780.html)
    *   Compared to the bucket sorting process, the difference lies in the number of buckets.

### Bucket sort

*   ["[Aha!</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Algorithms] The Fastest and Simplest Sorting - Bucket Sorting](http://blog.51cto.com/ahalei/1362789)
*   ["Sort Algorithm (3): Counting and Bucket Sorting"](https://blog.csdn.net/sunjinshengli/article/details/70738527)
    *   Bucket sorting divides the [0,1) interval into n sub-intervals of the same size, which are called buckets.
    *   Each bucket is sorted individually and then it traverses each bucket.

### Cardinal sort

Sort by rank, ten, hundred, ...

*   [Sort Algorithm Series: Cardinal Sorting](https://blog.csdn.net/lemon_tree12138/article/details/51695211)
*   [Cardinal Sort](https://www.cnblogs.com/skywang12345/p/3603669.html)

### Binary search

*   ["Two-point search (java implementation)"](https://www.cnblogs.com/coderising/p/5708632.html)

    *   The sequence to be searched is ordered.

## Bloom filter

Commonly used for big data, such as email, url, etc.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Core principle: Generate a fingerprint (a byte or bytes, but certainly a lot less than the original data) by calculating each piece of data, each of which is obtained by random calculation, mapping the fingerprint to a large The bitwise storage space.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note: There will be a certain error rate.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Advantages: High space and time efficiency.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Disadvantages: As the number of deposited elements increases, the miscalculation rate increases.

## Consistency, transaction

### Transaction ACID features

*   ["Database ACID Features"](https://blog.csdn.net/u012440687/article/details/52116108)

### Transaction isolation level

*   Uncommitted read: A transaction can read another uncommitted data and is prone to dirty reads.

*   Read submission: A transaction can read data only after another transaction has been submitted, but a non-repeatable read situation occurs (the read data is inconsistent), and an UPDATE operation occurs during the read process.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(The default level for most databases is RC, such as SQL Server, Oracle), which cannot be changed when reading.

*   Repeatable reading: The same transaction ensures that the same data is obtained for each read, but does not guarantee that the original data is updated (phantom read) by other transactions. Mysql InnoDB is this level.

*   Serialization: serial processing of all things (sacrificing efficiency)

### MVCC

*   ["[mysql] some understanding of MVCC in innodb"](https://www.cnblogs.com/chenpingzhao/p/5065316.html)

    *   The MVCC in innodb is used at the Repeatable-Read isolation level.
    *   MVCC produces phantom issues (updated exceptions.)
*   ["Easy understanding MYSQL MVCC implementation mechanism"](https://blog.csdn.net/whoamiyang/article/details/51901888)

    *   MVCC control is achieved by hiding the version column, a record creation time, a record deletion time, and the time
    *   Only operate on lines that are smaller (or equal) than the current version.

## lock

### Locks and synchronization classes in Java

*   ["Lock Classification in Java"](https://www.cnblogs.com/qifengshi/p/6831055.html)

    *   Mainly includes synchronized, ReentrantLock, and ReadWriteLock.
*   ["Java Concurrency AQS Detailed"](https://www.cnblogs.com/waterystone/p/4920797.html)

*   ["Signal Semaphore in Java"](http://cuisuqiang.iteye.com/blog/2020146)

    *   Quantity control
    *   Apply with acquire, apply for not blocked; release with release.
*   ["Mutex vs Semaphore in Java Development"](https://www.cnblogs.com/davidwang456/p/6094947.html)

    *   Simply put, Mutex is exclusive. Only one resource can be obtained. Semaphore is also exclusive, but it can define multiple objects that can be accessed.

### Fair lock & non-fair lock

The role of the fair lock is to execute in strict accordance with the order in which the threads are started, and no other thread is allowed to queue execution; non-fair locks are allowed to be queued.

*   [Fair and Unfair Locks](https://blog.csdn.net/EthanWhite/article/details/55508357)
    *   ReentrantLock and synchronized are both non-fair locks by default.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ReentrantLock can be set to fair lock.

### Pessimistic lock

Pessimistic locking, if used improperly (with too many locks), can cause large areas of service to wait.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is recommended to use optimistic locking + retries first.

*   ["[MySQL] Pessimistic Lock & Optimistic Lock"](https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiqian-ali/p/6200874.html)

    *   Optimistic locking method: version number + retry method
    *   Pessimistic locking: row locking via select ... for update (unreadable, non-writable, and share lock read-unreadable).
*   ["Mysql query statement using select.. for update database deadlock analysis"](https://www.cnblogs.com/Lawson/p/5008741.html)

    *   Although the innodb storage engine oracle's intrinsic lock is a lock line, it is internally locked.
    *   Different index conditions that lock the same data can cause deadlocks.
*   ["Mysql concurrent classic deadlock causes and solutions"](https://www.cnblogs.com/zejin2008/p/5262751.html)

### Optimistic Lock & CAS

*   ["An Optimistic Lock Implementation - CAS"](http://www.importnew.com/20472.html)
    *   It is similar to the MySQL optimistic lock method, but it is compared with the original value.

### ABA issues

Due to high concurrency, under CAS, this A may not be A after updating.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be solved by the version number, similar to the optimistic lock mentioned in Mysql above.

*   [Java CAS and ABA Issues](https://www.cnblogs.com/549294286/p/3766717.html)
*   ["ABA Problems and Avoidance in Java"](https://blog.csdn.net/li954644351/article/details/50511879)
    *   AtomicStampedReference and AtomicStampedReference.

### CopyOnWrite container

Concurrent reads can be made to the CopyOnWrite container without the need for locking.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The CopyOnWrite concurrent container is used to read multiple writes and fewer concurrent scenes.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, whitelists, blacklists, and visits and update scenarios for product categories are not suitable for scenarios that require strong data consistency.

*   ["Copy-On-Write Map Implementation in JAVA"](https://www.cnblogs.com/hapjin/p/4840107.html)

    *   Reading and writing are separated, reading occurs on the original data, and writing occurs on the copy.
    *   Without locking, consistency is finally achieved through consistency.
*   [Chat Concurrency - Copy-On-Write Container in Java](https://blog.csdn.net/a494303877/article/details/53404623)

### RingBuffer

*   ["Thread-safe, lock-free RingBuffer implementation [a read thread, a write thread]"](http://www.cnblogs.com/l00l/p/4115001.html)

### Reentrant Locks & Non-Reentrant Locks

*   [Reentrant and Non-Reentrant Locks](https://www.cnblogs.com/dj3839/p/6580765.html)

    *   Examples of reentrant locks and non-reentrant locks are illustrated by simple code.
    *   Reentrant locks mean that the same thread can regain previously acquired locks.
    *   Reentrant locks allow users to avoid deadlocks.
    *   Reentrant locks in Java: synchronized and java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock
*   ["ReenTrantLock reentrant lock (and the difference between synchronized) summary"](https://www.cnblogs.com/baizhanshi/p/7211802.html)

    *   Synchronized easy to use, the compiler to lock, is a non-fair lock.
    *   ReenTrantLock is flexible and lock fairness can be customized.
    *   In the same locked scenario, it is recommended to use synchronized.

### Mutexes & shared locks

Mutexes: Only one thread can acquire a lock at the same time.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, ReentrantLock is a mutex, and write locks in ReadWriteLock are mutexes.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shared locks: There can be multiple or simultaneous locks.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, Semaphore, CountDownLatch are shared locks, and read locks in ReadWriteLock are shared locks.

## CPU

### Multi-level cache

A typical CPU has three levels of cache. The closer it is to the core, the faster and the smaller the space.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">L1 is generally 32k, L2 is generally 256k, and L3 is generally 12M.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The memory speed requires 200 CPU cycles and the CPU cache requires 1 CPU cycle.

## Correspondence

*   ["Terminating Python Coroutines--Implementation from Yield to actor Model"](https://www.thinksaas.cn/group/topic/839375/)
    *   Thread scheduling is the responsibility of the operating system. Coroutine scheduling is the responsibility of the program.
    *   Compared with threads, coroutines reduce unnecessary operating system switching.
    *   In fact, when switching to an IO operation is more meaningful, (because the IO operation does not occupy the CPU), if no IO operation is encountered, switch according to the time slice.

# Design Patterns

## Six principles of design patterns

*   [The Six Principles of Design Patterns](https://blog.csdn.net/q291611265/article/details/48465113)
    *   The principle of opening and closing: open to the extension, close to the modification, use more abstract classes and interfaces.
    *   Lie substitution principle: the base class can be replaced by subclasses, use abstract class inheritance, do not use concrete class inheritance.
    *   Relying on the principle of reversal: to rely on abstraction, not relying on the specific, programming for the interface, not for programming.
    *   Interface isolation principle: Using multiple isolated interfaces is better than using a single interface to establish a minimal interface.
    *   Dimit's Law: A software entity should interact with other entities as little as possible and establish links through intermediate classes.
    *   Synthetic reuse principles: Use synthetic/aggregate as much as possible instead of using inheritance.

## 23 common design patterns

*   ["Design Patterns"](http://www.runoob.com/design-pattern/design-pattern-tutorial.html)
*   ["23 kinds of design patterns full analysis"](https://www.cnblogs.com/susanws/p/5510229.html)

## Application scenario

*   ["Detailed Design Patterns in the JDK"](http://blog.jobbole.com/62314/)

    *   Structural mode:

        *   Adapter: Used to convert an interface to another interface, such as java.util.Arrays#asList().
        *   Bridge mode: This mode decouples the implementation of abstract and abstract operations, so that the abstraction and implementation can be independently changed, such as JDBC;
        *   Combined mode: Makes the client seem to have the same combination of individual objects and objects.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In other words, a certain type of method also accepts its own type as parameters, such as Map.putAll, List.addAll, Set.addAll.
        *   Decorator pattern: Dynamically adds an extra function to an object, which is an alternative to subclasses, such as java.util.Collections#checkedList|Map|Set|SortedSet|SortedMap.
        *   Fragmentation mode: use caching to speed up the access time of a large number of small objects, such as valueOf(int).
        *   Proxy mode: The proxy mode is to replace a complex or time-consuming object with a simple object, such as java.lang.reflect.Proxy
    *   Create mode:

        *   Abstract factory pattern: The abstract factory pattern provides a protocol to generate a series of related or independent objects without specifying the concrete object type, such as java.util.Calendar#getInstance().
        *   Builder: A new class is defined to build an instance of another class to simplify the creation of complex objects such as: java.lang.StringBuilder#append().
        *   Factory method: that</font> </font>**a return**<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">* back to the specific object methods, rather than several, such as java.lang.Object # toString (), java.lang.Class # newInstance ().
        *   Prototype mode: Makes an instance of a class generate its own copy, such as: java.lang.Object#clone().
        *   Singleton mode: There is only one instance globally, such as java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime().

        *   Command mode: encapsulates operations into objects for storage, delivery, and return, such as: java.lang.Runnable.
        *   Interpreter mode: defines the syntax of a language, and then parses the corresponding syntax statement, such as java.text.Format, java.text.Normalizer.
        *   Iterator mode: Provides a consistent method for sequentially accessing objects in a collection, such as java.util.Iterator.
        *   Mediator pattern: java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke() by using an intermediate object for message distribution and reducing the direct dependency between classes.
        *   Empty object patterns: such as java.util.Collections#emptyList().
        *   Observer pattern: It allows an object to send messages to interested objects flexibly, such as java.util.EventListener.
        *   Template method pattern: Allows subclasses to override part of the method instead of the entire rewrite, such as java.util.Collections#sort().

### Nginx

*   ["Basic Learning of Ngnix - Comparison of Multiple Processes and Apache"](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_25797077/article/details/52200722)

    *   Nginx achieves high concurrency through asynchronous non-blocking event handling mechanisms.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apache monopolizes one thread per request and consumes system resources.
    *   Event-driven is suitable for IO intensive services (Nginx), multi-process or thread-adapted to CPU-intensive services (Apache), so Nginx is suitable for reverse proxy, not web server use.
*   ["Comparisons and advantages and disadvantages of nginx and Apache"](https://www.cnblogs.com/cunkouzh/p/5410154.html)

    *   Nginx is only suitable for static and reverse proxies and is not suitable for handling dynamic requests.

*   ["Tomcat System Architecture and Design Patterns, Part 1: How It Works"](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-tomcat1/)

*   ["Four Diagrams Take You Through Tomcat System Architecture"](https://blog.csdn.net/xlgen157387/article/details/79006434)

*   ["JBoss vs. Tomcat: Choosing A Java Application Server"](https://www.futurehosting.com/blog/jboss-vs-tomcat-choosing-a-java-application-server/)

    *   Tomcat is a lightweight Serverlet container that does not implement all JEE features (such as persistence and transaction processing) but can be replaced by other components such as Srping.
    *   Jboss implements all JEE features, free software open source, and documentation fees.

#### Tuning plan

*   [Tomcat Tuning Solution](https://www.cnblogs.com/sunfenqing/p/7339058.html)

    *   Start NIO mode (or APR); adjust thread pool; disable AJP connector (Nginx+tomcat architecture, no AJP required);
*   ["tomcat http protocol and ajp protocol"](http://blog.chinaunix.net/uid-20662363-id-3012760.html)

*   [AJP vs. HTTP Comparison and Analysis](http://dmouse.iteye.com/blog/1354527)

    *   The AJP protocol (port 8009) is used to reduce the number of connections (front-end) to the front-end Server (such as Apache, which also needs to support the AJP protocol), and to increase performance through long connections.
    *   When concurrency is high, the AJP protocol is better than the HTTP protocol.

### Jetty

*   ["How Jetty Works and Comparison with Tomcat"](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cn/java/j-lo-jetty/)
*   ["Compared advantages of jetty and tomcat"](https://blog.csdn.net/doutao6677/article/details/51957288)
    *   Architecture comparison: Jetty's architecture is much simpler than Tomcat's.
    *   Performance comparison: Jetty and Tomcat have little difference in performance. Jetty uses NIO to end up with more advantages in handling I/O requests. Tomcat uses BIO to handle I/O requests by default. Tomcat is suitable for handling a few very busy links and handles static resources. Poor performance.
    *   Other aspects: The application of Jetty is faster, simpler to modify, and better supported by the new Servlet specification; Tomcat supports JEE and Servlet more comprehensively.

    *   Use multiplexing techniques to increase concurrency.
    *   The slab allocation algorithm: memcached allocates memory space for Slab, the default is 1MB.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After allocating to Slab, the slab of the slab is divided into chunks of the same size. Chunk is the memory space used to cache the records. The chunk size is incremented by 1.25 times by default.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The advantage is that it will not frequently apply for memory and improve IO efficiency. The disadvantage is that there will be a certain amount of memory waste.

*   Features: You can configure the number of backup nodes, asynchronously to the backup node
*   Consistent hashing algorithm.
*   Architecture: Similar to the design concept of Hadoop, Configserver, DataServer, and Configserver are used to detect heartbeats. Configserver also has a master/slave relationship.

Several storage engines:

*   MDB, full memory, can be used to store data such as Session.
*   Rdb (similar to Redis), lightweight, removes operations like aof, supports Restfull operations
*   LDB (LevelDB storage engine), persistent storage, LDB as a persistence of rdb, google implementation, more efficient, theoretical basis is the LSM (Log-Structured-Merge Tree) algorithm, now modify the data in memory, reach a certain amount (and Memory aggregated old data is written to disk together. Write to disk and storage is more efficient. The county compares the hash algorithm.
*   Tair uses shared memory to store data. If the service goes down (not the server), the data is still available after the service is restarted.

## message queue

*   [Message Queue - Push/Pull Mode Learning & ActiveMQ and JMS Learning](https://www.cnblogs.com/charlesblc/p/6045238.html)

    *   The RabbitMQ consumer defaults to push mode (also supports pull mode).
    *   Kafka defaults to pull mode.
    *   Push mode: The advantage is that the message can be sent to the consumer as soon as possible. The disadvantage is that if the consumer's processing power cannot keep up, the consumer's buffer may overflow.
    *   Pull: The advantage is that the consumer can pull it off according to its processing power. The disadvantage is that it will increase the message delay.

## Network model

*   ["The principles of web optimization must understand the five models of the I/O and the three working modes of the web."](http://blog.51cto.com/litaotao/1289790)

    *   Five I/O models: Blocking I/O, Non-blocking I/O, I/O Multiplexing, Event (Signal) Driven I/O, Asynchronous I/O, and the first four I/Os are synchronous operations, I/O The first stage of O is the same and the second stage is the same. The last one belongs to asynchronous operation.
    *   Three kinds of Web Server work methods: Prefork (multi-process), Worker mode (thread mode), Event mode.
*   [Summary of differences between select, poll, and epoll](http://www.cnblogs.com/Anker/p/3265058.html)

    *   Select, poll, and epoll are essentially synchronous I/O because they all need to be responsible for reading and writing after the read/write event is ready. This means that the read/write process is blocked.
    *   Select has a limit on the number of open file descriptors, the default is 1024 (2048 for x64), 1 million concurrent, 1000 processes will be used, and the switching overhead is large; poll uses the linked list structure, and there is no limit to the number.
    *   Select, poll "wake up" when iterating over the entire fd collection, and epoll "wake up" as long as the judgment is ready list is empty, through the callback mechanism to save a lot of CPU time; select, poll call every time To copy the fd set from the user state to the kernel state, epoll only needs to copy once.
    *   With the increase of concurrent poll, the performance gradually declines. Epoll adopts the red-black tree structure and has stable performance. It will not decrease as the number of connections increases.
*   ["select, poll, epoll comparison"](http://xingyunbaijunwei.blog.163.com/blog/static/76538067201241685556302/)

    *   In situations where the number of connections is small and the connections are very active, the performance of select and poll may be better than epoll. After all, the epoll notification mechanism requires a lot of function callbacks.

### Three paradigms of database design

*   ["Three Paradigms of Database and Five Constraints"](https://www.cnblogs.com/waj6511988/p/7027127.html)
    *   The first normal form: each column (each field) in the data table must be the smallest unit that cannot be split, that is, to ensure the atomicity of each column;
    *   Second Normal Form (2NF): After satisfying 1NF, all the columns in the table must be dependent on the primary key. No column can be related to the primary key. That is, a table describes only one thing.
    *   The third paradigm: must meet the second paradigm (2NF), requirements: each column in the table is only directly related to the primary key and not indirectly, (each column in the table can only rely on the primary key);

### Service Routing Control

*   [Distributed Services Framework Study Notes 4 Service Routing](https://blog.csdn.net/xundh/article/details/59492750)
    *   Principle: Transparent routing
    *   Load Balancing Policy: Random, Polling, Service Call Latency, Consistent Hash, Sticky Connection
    *   Local routing has a limited strategy: injvm (preferentially calling jvm internal services) and initial (priority using the same physical machine services), and in principle finding the nearest service.
    *   Configuration method: unified registry, local configuration, and dynamic delivery.

## Distributed consensus

### CAP and BASE theory

*   ["Discussing CAP Theory, BASE Theory from Distributed Consistency"](http://www.cnblogs.com/szlbm/p/5588543.html)
    *   Consistency classification: strong agreement (immediately consistent); weakly consistent (achievable in units of time, such as seconds); eventually consistent (weakly consistent, eventually consistent within a certain period of time)
    *   CAP: Consistency, Availability, Partition Fault Tolerance (Cause of Network Failure)
    *   BASE: Basically Available, Soft state, and Eventually consistent
    *   The core idea of ​​BASE theory is: Even if it can not achieve strong consistency, but each application can be based on their own business characteristics, using appropriate methods to achieve the final consistency of the system.

# Design Ideas & Development Models

## 

*   ["Talking about my understanding of DDD-driven design"](https://www.cnblogs.com/netfocus/p/5548025.html)

    *   Concept: DDD is mainly proposed for the separation of the various stages of the traditional software development process (Analysis-Design-Code) to avoid undeliverable software (and requirements) due to unclear analysis at first or inconsistent information flow during software development. Assuming inconsistencies).</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">DDD emphasizes that everything is centered on the domain and emphasizes the role of Domain Expert. It emphasizes that the domain model is first defined and then developed, and the domain model can guide the development (the so-called driver).
    *   Process: Understanding the domain, splitting the domain, refining the domain, the accuracy of the model depends on the depth of understanding of the model.
    *   Design: DDD proposes modeling tools such as aggregations, entities, value objects, factories, warehousing, domain services, and domain events to help with domain modeling.
*   ["Summary of Domain Driven Design Basics"](https://www.cnblogs.com/butterfly100/p/7827870.html)

    *   Domain (Doamin) is essentially a problem domain, such as an e-commerce system, a forum system, etc.
    *   Bounded Context: Explains the relationship between subdomains and can be simply understood as a subsystem or component module.
    *   Domain Model: The core of DDD is to establish the correct domain model (using universal description language, tools, and domain common language); to reflect the nature of business requirements, including entities and processes; it runs through software analysis, design, and development. Process; commonly used expression field model: diagram, code or text;
    *   Domain common language: Domain experts, developers and designers can have immediate language or tools.
    *   The classic layered architecture: user interface/presentation layer, application layer, domain layer, and infrastructure layer is a four-tier architecture model.
    *   The mode used:
        *   Link as little as possible, as far as possible single item, try to reduce the overall complexity.
        *   Entity: The only indication in the domain that an entity has as few attributes as possible and at least as clear.
        *   Value Object: There is no unique identifier, and the property value is immutable. The second is a simple object, such as Date.
        *   Domain Service: Coordinate multiple domain objects, only the method has no state (no data); it can be divided into application layer services, domain layer services, and basic layer services.
        *   Aggregate, Aggregate Root: Aggregate defines a set of related objects with a cohesive relationship; the aggregate root is the only element of the aggregate reference; when modifying an aggregate, it must be at the transaction level; most areas In the model, 70% of aggregates usually have only one entity, and 30% only have 2 to 3 entities; if an aggregate has only one entity, then this entity is the aggregate root; if there are multiple entities, then we can think about which object in the aggregate Has independent significance and can interact with the outside directly;
        *   Factory: Similar to the factory mode in design mode.
        *   Repository: Persisting to DB, managing objects, and designing storage only for aggregates.
*   ["Realm Driven Design (DDD) Road to Realization"](http://www.cnblogs.com/Leo_wl/p/3866629.html)

    *   The core idea: read and write separation (inquiry and update in different methods), different processes are only different design methods, CQ code separation, there will be obvious manifestation in the distributed environment (in the case of redundant data), the purpose is For high performance.

### Anemia, congestive model

*   ["Anemia, explanation of hyperemia model, and some experience"](https://kb.cnblogs.com/page/520743/)
    *   Blood loss model: Lao Tzu and son are defined separately, and they do not know each other. There is no business logic in the entity definition of the two, and they are related through external services.
    *   Anemia model: Laozi knows son, son also knows Laozi; part of the business logic is put into the entity; Advantages: Individual layers of dependent, structural clear, easy to maintain; Disadvantages: does not meet the OO thinking, compared to the congestion model, the service layer is more heavy ;
    *   Congestion model: Similar to the anemia model, the difference lies in how to divide the business logic.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Advantages: The service layer is relatively thin, only acts as a facade, does not deal with DAO, compound OO thinking; disadvantages: non-single dependency, bi-directional dependency between DO and DAO, and logical division of the Service layer is likely to cause confusion.
    *   Swollen mode: It is an extreme situation, cancel the service layer, all the business logic in DO; Advantages: in line with OO ideas, simplification of layering; Disadvantages: too much exposure information, many non-DO logic will be forced into DO.</font> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This pattern should be avoided.
    *   The authors advocate using the anemia model.
